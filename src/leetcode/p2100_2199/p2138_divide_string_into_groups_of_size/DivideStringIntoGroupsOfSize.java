     *   the string, and so on. Each character can be a part of exactly
     *   one group.

     *   remaining, a character fill is used to complete the group.
     * <p>

     * character from the last group (if it exists) and concatenating
     * all the groups in order, the resultant string should be s.
     * <p>
     * Given the string s, the size of each group k and the character
     * fill, return a string array denoting the composition of every
     * group s has been divided into, using the above procedure.
     *
     * @param s 1 <= s.length <= 100
     *          consists of lowercase English letters only.
     * @param k 1 <= k <= 100
     * @param fill is a lowercase English letter.
