     * The steps of the insertion sort algorithm:
     * <p>
     * Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each
     * repetition and growing a sorted output list.
     * At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the
     * input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list
     * and inserts it there.
     * It repeats until no input elements remain.
     * The following is a graphical example of the insertion sort
     * algorithm. The partially sorted list (black) initially contains
     * only the first element in the list. One element (red) is removed
     * from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list
     * with each iteration.
     *
     * @param head The number of nodes in the list is in the range
     *             [1, 5000].
     *             -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
