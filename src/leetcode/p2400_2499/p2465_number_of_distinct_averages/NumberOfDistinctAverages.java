     * You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of even length.

     * As long as nums is not empty, you must repetitively:
     * <p>
     * - Find the minimum number in nums and remove it.
     * - Find the maximum number in nums and remove it.
     * - Calculate the average of the two removed numbers.

     * The average of two numbers a and b is (a + b) / 2.
     * <p>
     * - For example, the average of 2 and 3 is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
