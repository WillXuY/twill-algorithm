     * Tic-tac-toe is played by two players A and B on a 3 x 3 grid. The
     * rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are:
     * - Players take turns placing characters into empty squares ' '.
     * - The first player A always places 'X' characters, while the
     *   second player B always places 'O' characters.
     * - 'X' and 'O' characters are always placed into empty squares,
     *   never on filled ones.
     * - The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty)
     *   character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
     * - The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
     * - No more moves can be played if the game is over.
     * Given a 2D integer array moves where moves[i] = [row_i, col_i]
     * indicates that the i^th move will be played on
     * grid[row_i][col_i]. return the winner of the game if it exists
     * (A or B). In case the game ends in a draw return "Draw". If there
     * are still movements to play return "Pending".
     * You can assume that moves is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of
     * Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty, and A will play first.
