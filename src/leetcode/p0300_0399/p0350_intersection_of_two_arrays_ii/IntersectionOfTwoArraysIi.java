     * - What if the given array is already sorted? How would you
     *   optimize your algorithm?
     * - What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which
     *   algorithm is better?
     * - What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is
     *   limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory
     *   at once?
