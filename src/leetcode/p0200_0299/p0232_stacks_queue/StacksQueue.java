 * You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means
 * only push to top, peek/pop from top, size and is empty operations
 * are valid.
 * Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported
 * natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque
 * (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard
 * operations.
 *
 * Follow-up: Can you implement the queue such that each operation is
 * amortized O(1) time complexity? In other words, performing n
 * operations will take overall O(n) time even if one of those
 * operations may take longer.
