     * In MATLAB, there is a handy function called reshape which can
     * reshape an m x n matrix into a new one with a different size
     * r x c keeping its original data.
     * You are given an m x n matrix mat and two integers r and c
     * representing the number of rows and the number of columns of the
     * wanted reshaped matrix.
     * The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the
     * original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.
     * If the reshape operation with given parameters is possible and
     * legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the
     * original matrix.
