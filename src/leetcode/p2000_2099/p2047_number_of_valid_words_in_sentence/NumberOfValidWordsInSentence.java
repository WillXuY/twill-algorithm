     * - It only contains lowercase letters, hyphens, and/or punctuation
     *   (no digits).
     * - There is at most one hyphen '-'. If present, it must be

     *   and "ab-" are not valid).
     * - There is at most one punctuation mark. If present, it must be
     *   at the end of the token ("ab,", "cd!", and "." are valid, but
