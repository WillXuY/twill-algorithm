/**
 * Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue
 * is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed
 * based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle and the last position
 * is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also
 * called "Ring Buffer".
 * One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of
 * the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue
 * becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a
 * space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use
 * the space to store new values.
 *
 * At most 3000 calls will be made to enQueue, deQueue, Front, Rear,
 * isEmpty, and isFull.
