     * You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot
     * initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The
     * robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner
     * (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down
     * or right at any point in time.
     * <p>
     * An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid.
     * A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an
     * obstacle.

     * Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can
     * take to reach the bottom-right corner.
     * <p>

     * or equal to 2 * 109.
