     * You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in

     * Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in
     * non-decreasing order.

     * The final sorted array should not be returned by the function,

     * this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements
     * denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n
     * elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length
     * of n.
     *
     * Constraints:
     * 1 <= m + n <= 200

     * Follow up:
     * Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?
