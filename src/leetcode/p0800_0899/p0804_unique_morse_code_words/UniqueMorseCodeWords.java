     * International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each
     * letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows:
     * - 'a' maps to ".-",
     * - 'b' maps to "-...",
     * - 'c' maps to "-.-.", and so on.
     * For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English
     * alphabet is given below:
     * [".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.",
     * "....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.",
     * "---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-",
     * "..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]
     * Given an array of strings words where each word can be written as
     * a concatenation of the Morse code of each letter.
     * - For example, "cab" can be written as "-.-..--...", which is the
     *   concatenation of "-.-.", ".-", and "-...". We will call such a
     *   concatenation the transformation of a word.
     * Return the number of different transformations among all words we
     * have.
